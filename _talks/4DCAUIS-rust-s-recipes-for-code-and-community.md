    E. Dunham is a DevOps engineer at Mozilla, a role which has involved

    include gardening, carpentry, and filing “please license your code” issues
    on GitHub.

  In some ways, a browser engine seems to have little in common with a web
  framework. But both are ambitious software projects, approached by large
  groups of diverse people trying and sometimes failing to cooperate,
  collaborate, and code together. This talk shares firsthand observations,
  collected over 3 years of working within the Rust and Servo teams at Mozilla
  as well as volunteering on the Rust Community Team, about what all developers
  can learn from Rust's approaches to the universal challenges of code and
  community.
