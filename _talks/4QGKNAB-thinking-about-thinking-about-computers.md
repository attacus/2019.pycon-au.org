- biography: G'day! I'm a developer and designer at Grok Learning, where I help make
    a platform that teaches school students to code. I find the topic of learning
    super interesting, so I'm studying it as well, slowly working on a PhD at Sydney
    Uni (part time). In my spare time I like to go bouldering, listen to EDM, drink
    wine and sing sea shanties. Ask me for fun facts about learning.

      Let's talk about computers: I don't know how they work, but when I'm writing code I *can* imagine what it will do. I can think through, at length, what will happen at each step. So what's the deal with that? I reckon it's time to think about thinking about computers.

So you're writing some code, you give it a run and look at the output. Shock! Horror! The output is totally different to what you expected. Where is the error? Is the computer wrong? Is your code wrong? If you've been here before you know the more common answer: you thought the code worked differently to how it actually works. The bug was inside your brain all along (an unfortunate place for it to live).

As we learn to code, and practice coding, we build up mental models of how the computer works. But as professional programmers we don't often talk about those mental models. In this talk I'll introduce some concepts from Computer Science Education to help us, as professionals, talk and think about how we think about coding. With the right words we can think about new ideas, challenge our own thinking and communicate our thoughts more effectively.
