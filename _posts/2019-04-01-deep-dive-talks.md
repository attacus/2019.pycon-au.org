One piece of feedback we received on last year's program was an interest in seeing more "expert" level content. To address this, for PyCon AU 2019, we're including a "Deep Dive" talks - a selection of talks dedicated to highly technical content, aimed at those who are already familiar with the basics, and are looking to level-up their professional usage of Python.

The audience for a deep dive talk is someone who is already familiar with the problem domain, and the core Python libraries related to that domain.

Examples of possible Deep Dive talks might be (but are not limited to):

* "What comes after the tutorial?" talks - walkthroughs how to solve complex, real world problems with Python.
* "Internals" talks - Detailed walkthroughs of the internal architecture of a well known project, describing how it is architected to provide the clean external interface for users.
* "Professional skills" talks - taking your skills as a team-based software developer to the next level.
* "Theory" talks - providing explainers of the mathematical or conceptual underpinnings of a subject domain.

To reflect the complexity of the subject matter being presented, Deep Dive talks will be allocated at 70min slot (includes question time), rather than 30 minutes. The number of places will also be limited - longer talks means less speaking slots will be available. We'll be using the same blind-review process to assess proposals, but we'll be giving Deep Dive proposals additional scrutiny to ensure that the content will provide value for the audience, and that the speaker has sufficient expertise to deliver that content. The number of Deep Dive talks we ultimately accept will depend on the submissions we receive.

We look forward to seeing deep dive proposals the community. Or, if you've got a subject that you'd like to see as a deep dive, but don't have the expertise to give it yourself - get in touch!
